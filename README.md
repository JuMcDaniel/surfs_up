The purpose of this analysis was to determine the difference between temperatures from December and June for the surf shop.  Overall, the location has consistent temperatures.  This is a perfect for surfing weather year-round and ice cream.  

  Average temperature:
  
    •	June: 75 degrees
    •	December: 71 degrees
    
  Lowest temperature:
  
    •	June: 64 degrees
    •	December: 56 degrees
    
These are the main temperatures of concern in order to sell ice cream.  In December sales may fall due to having lower temperatures overall and having a lower “lowest temperature.”  The other queries I would run in order to get a better picture is monitoring rain amounts because that will decrease ice cream sales.  Also, monitoring tourist season and manage marketing during those peak seasons.
